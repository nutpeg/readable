This is a simple blogging web app which allows users to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users can also edit and delete posts and comments.

## Getting Started

To get started:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the frontend server
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

A development web server will start up and open up a browser tab at the appropriate port.
